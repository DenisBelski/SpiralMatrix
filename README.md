This project implemented a solution to fill a square matrix with an input size. The matrix is filled with natural numbers from 1 to size in increments of 1, starting from the upper left corner and twisting its elements in a clockwise spiral, as shown in the following example:

Input size = 4
Spiral matrix:

 1  2  3  4   
 12 13 14 5  
 11 16 15 6  
 10 9  8  7
